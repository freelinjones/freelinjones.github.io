	    	<h2>What My Colleagues Say</h2>
			<hr></hr>
			<p>
			<strong>Valeria Blanchette</strong>, Manager of Corporate Planning at Genova Diagnostics, says “Freelin has contributed significantly to Genova Diagnostics especially in the areas of customer database integration and improvement. I worked with Freelin closely on a very large-scale database integration. Freelin excelled at identifying and correcting data management issues, developing correct data integrity procedures, and ensured quality work for his team. I would highly recommend Freelin's work in database management. He is a huge asset to the organization in terms of taking initiative, teamwork, quality, and innovation.”<br/>
			</p>

			<strong>Nancy West</strong>, corporate consultant, says “Freelin is a multi-talented individual. He has excellent writing skills for both information and marketing purposes. He used these skills working with clients while he pursued his graduate degree. Freelin is willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done and is able to transition between tasks. Clients have commented they appreciate his concern for their viewpoints. He is a team player and is valued by senior management and his peers. Any company is fortunate to have Freelin on their team.”<br/>
			</p>

			<strong>Elizabeth Bridgers</strong>, former Marketing Director at Genova Diagnostics, says “Freelin is an enthusiastic team player with the ability to manage projects and other team members in a collegial manner so that they feel valued and don’t always realize they are being managed. His strength in writing and communications made him a valuable asset in a variety of situations and Freelin was able to quickly jump from one task to another seamlessly. His writing skills demonstrate his ability to think creatively, leading the team through challenges with new approaches that could be implemented. Specifically, Freelin was responsible for mapping out the navigation architecture for a major overhaul/update of the GDx website. He managed the organization, architecture, and content during the site’s construction, working with outside vendors and our internal Medical Education department to ensure that the site’s function was enhanced for optimal user-friendliness. He was responsible for beginning the company’s first entre into social media which required him to concept content, strategies and schedules, but also to design page headers and other online graphics. His quiet wit is a favorite among the department staff and he’s generally the one to slide in an insightful zinger just when we least expected it and when we most needed it. He understands that the basic tenet of successful business lies within efficient friendly customer service. Freelin’s work ethic is strong such that during busy times, he would work late and come in early to make sure that projects were completed on time without sacrificing quality. He was a delight to work with personally and professionally.”<br/>

			<strong>Christopher Power</strong>, former Public Relations Specialist at Pardee Hospital, says “Freelin was a joy to work with! His creativity and enthusiasm was only matched by his professionalism. He could always be counted on to take a project from conception to completion on time and within budget. He has a pleasant attitude and works well in both team-based and individual work environments. I would highly recommend Freelin for virtually any professional position. I would be happy to discuss Freelin and his superb work ethics in detail with anyone that is interested!”<br/>

			<strong>Edward Terry</strong>, former News Editor at The (Lenoir) News Topic, says “Freelin was a hard worker, always brought a positive attitude and was the kind of person I liked having on my team. He always handled deadline pressure with poise and worked well with everyone on staff. In addition to being intelligent, Freelin paid attention to detail and was dependable.”<br/>
